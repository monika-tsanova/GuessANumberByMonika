This project is a simple number guessing game implemented in Python. The program generates a random number based on three difficulty levels, and the player has to guess it. The program provides feedback on whether the guessed number is too low or too high until the correct number is guessed.

At the beginning of the game, the player starts with 100 points. With each incorrect guess, the player loses points depending on the difficulty level and remaining attempts.

Level 1 – Easy: Number from 1 to 50 with 10 attempts

Level 2 – Medium: Number from 1 to 100 with 7 attempts

Level 3 – Hard: Number from 1 to 200 with 5 attempts
